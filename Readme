-> host.cpp: Contains the host code which initializes the matrices with random numbers, initializes the OpenCL platforms, then dispatches the kernel.
-> host.h: Contains the definitions of all the variables/sizes. Note that if tile size is changed here, it has to also be changed in the OpenCL file.
-> gemm.cl: Contains the OpenCL kernel for a tiled matrix matrix multiply.
